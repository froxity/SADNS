Hello my name is **Ahmad Afiq Azmi**, Final year computer science student (*Computer System & Networking*). I'm in charge developing web-based application for this **SA DNS Filtering System**.

# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to build a DNS Filtering system for traffic monitoring for parental control applications. Users and system developers are among the target audiences for this project

The design will also provide interface design models that are consistent, user friendly and will provide straightforward transitions through the various system functions.

# System Overview
The application is a client-server based system, which contains five components: user interfaces (clients), network (communication), web server, RESTful, DNS server and database server. The database will be stored using SQL server and accessed using the RESTful server.
